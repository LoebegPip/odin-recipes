        <li>Cut the meat into 2cm cubes and place in a large mixing bowl. Add the marinade ingredients and, using your hands, massage the pieces until they are evenly coated, then add the cornflour and rub it into the meat.

        <li>Half-fill a large pot, wok or deep-fryer with vegetable oil and heat to 180°C (350°F), or until the tip of a wooden chopstick or skewer starts to fizz after a second or so in the oil. Carefully add the marinated meat and deep-fry until golden brown, about 1 - 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the pieces carefully with a slotted spoon and drain well on a plate covered with kitchen paper.</li>
        <li>In a separate wok, heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil over a high heat until smoking-hot. Add the spring onion, garlic, ginger and chillies and stir-fry for 1 minute until the it’s starts to get fragrant, then pour over the sauce and bring to a vigorous boil.</li>
        <li>Once boiling, add the beef pieces and toss through a few times to mix everything together. Serve immediately.</li>
